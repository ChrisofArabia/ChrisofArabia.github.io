Although I've updated the site here to use the 'Slate' theme, it isn't working. Despite migrating the Gemfile across to using 'githib-pages' instead of Jekyll, running
`gem install github-pages`
then
`bundle update`

which appear to have worked successfully, still nothin appears, and the site continues to show 'jekyll-athena' as its theme. Something in the build not getting across maybe?
