Although I've updated the site here to use the 'Slate' theme, it isn't working. Despite migrating the Gemfile across to using 'githib-pages' instead of Jekyll, running

`gem install github-pages`

then

`bundle update`

which appear to have worked successfully, still nothing appears, and the site continues to show 'jekyll-athena' as its theme. Something in the build not getting across maybe, but not sure what?

The following sequence of links have been followed, but still no joy...

["No GitHub API authentication" error #399](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/399)

[Jekyll with GitHub Pages - Fix the "GitHub Metadata No GitHub API authentication could be found" Error](http://knightcodes.com/miscellaneous/2016/09/13/fix-github-metadata-error.html)

[Resolve “No Github API authentication” errors](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/mydoc_install_jekyll_on_mac.html#githuberror)

Something to do with using a `~/.zshrc` file, rather than a `~/.bash_profile` maybe?
