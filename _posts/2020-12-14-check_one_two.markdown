## Ignore me

This is a test. For various reasons, the accounts, permissions, Homebrew, Ruby and Jekyll installations got a bit messed up when I migrated my Macbook Air data across to the Mac Mini around 18 months ago. It has been a labour of luck (not love) that I finally got things running again this morning. All being well, anyone who wants to (don't do that to yourselves please people), should be able to read this.

More soon and bye for now.

Chris
