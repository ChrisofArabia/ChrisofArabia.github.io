Having worked for many years around a development team, I knew I wanted to be able to translate my own ideas into reality, but lacked the skills and thought process to be able to do that. Discovering GA gave me a route to be able to close the gap. The part of the GA experience I enjoyed most was that I could finally understand how modern web applications are structured. I want to use this new knowledge as a stepping stone to being able to make the web accessible to all, whether young, old, or infirm.

I am now a full-stack developer with a keen focus on building solutions that are accessible for all in a world that is rapidly becoming digitised. Being able to see such rapid results on the screen in front of you is what has attracted me to web development. If I can help improve the lives or productivity of those using what I create, I would consider it a job well done.


## Work experience

### Senior Project Manager, International Systems Engineering Ltd, a BAE Systems subsidiary, Riyadh 2014 – 2016

Delivered several class-leading IT infrastructure solutions into ISE’s parent company, BAe Systems. These included a secure virtual server platform based on Cisco UCS technology, the implementation of a tablet trial, selecting the MS Surface Pro as the preferred platform for wider scale deployment, introduced a Riverbed solution for the  monitoring and reporting on LAN/WAN network traffic, managed a Xerox DocuCenter refresh, including the introduction of an Equitrac ‘Follow-You’ print solution from concept, through design and deployment into operational readiness and support, and working directly for the VP Finance, developing reporting structures and processes required to track and reduce costs across approximately 1,800 mobile communications accounts.


### Account Manager, International Systems Engineering Ltd, a BAE Systems subsidiary, Riyadh 2011 - 2014

Acting as the primary point of contact for all aspects of contract engagement, and the escalation of service delivery issues for the BAE Systems customer on a contract valued at circa £10-12M per annum. During my tenure, I was a core member of the team leading the transition of a joint BAE Systems/ISE Business Agreement into a Service Management Contract, including overseeing project scope, its development and agreeing a set of ITIL-based SLA’s.

As the system owner of the in-house customer engagement tool I lead the activity to integrate a newly developed procurement database, to help ease system and process bottlenecks, whilst improving reporting capabilities for customers. This helped improve the provision of critical input and analysis of year-end invoicing reconciliation for procurement/project accounting. Whilst in the role, the account delivered proposals and quotations to the value of £10M in additional business, which included the introduction of a VMWare server platform, a SharePoint document management system and a country-wide network refresh programme


## Education

My education has been largely engineering based, originating in the Royal Air Force where I trained as aircraft communications technician diagnosing and repairing radio & navigational aids. After leaving the RAF, I studied a Diploma in Management Studies over a 5 year period through the Open University. Since then I have gained the  PRINCE2 and MSP certifications to support the many years of practical project management experience.


## Interests

When I’m not coding, I can often be found out cycling around the Fylde coast, or perhaps visiting the Lake District for a little hill walking or rock climbing. If not that, then I’ll likely be found working on renovating a 1930’s semi my wife and I have recently purchased. In between times, I’ll be helping moderate the [Sitepoint Forum](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/), and answering other members’ question where I’m able.

I have been interested in photography for many years, originally using film, where I would often process and print in B&W, now though I am almost wholly digital, and am a competent Photoshop user.

I love live music, and enjoy playing my small collection of electric, acoustic and bass guitars. Through this, I have learnt how to set-up and repair guitars for myself and friends.
