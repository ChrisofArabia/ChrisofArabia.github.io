## Aims
- Build an application that would leverage the Google Maps API
- Provide the ability for users to create their own walk by either selecting existing landmarks, or by adding landmarks of their own
- Give the user the ability to record their walks and show the images they took during it

## Technologies Used

- CSS/SASS
- Skeleton
- AngularJS
- Express.js
- MongoDB API
- Mongoose
- Google Maps
- JWT token authentication
- Gulp
- Babel

## Successes
- Building an API to house the locations to be placed on the map, and getting this seeded with suitable data
- Creating a re-useable (DRY) function for creating a modal where required
- Learning how the Google Maps API works, and seeing the extent to which it can be manipulated


## Challenges
- Working with a single `client.js` file that contained API, map, template and application logic
- Developing a good understanding of MVC build patterns and the way which they are structured
- Time constraints involved in creating a minimum viable product

## Future Development
- Add the ability to upload images
- Enhance the 'admin' functionality and backend management tools


## Live Version
- a live version of the app can be found on Heroku at ['Photo Walk'](https://fierce-fortress-98221.herokuapp.com/)
- The code for the app can be located on ['GitHub' - 'WDI_PROJECT_3'](https://github.com/christopherallanperry/WDI_PROJECT_3)
- To get started, register on the site as a new user
